This is a Python cryptocurrency calculator using data via www.coinmarketcap.com to calculate the value of a specified quantity of one or
more cryptocurrencies. The information for each coin returned include the name, ticker, current rank, current price, and value (according 
to the quantity specified by the user). This script is currently written for version v1 of the Coinmarketcap API documentation.

Before the script can be functional, the user must enter their Coinmarketcap API key as a string on line 7. This script will work for all
Coinmarketcap API plans. Upon successfully running the script, one credit from your Coinmarketcap account will be used immediately and one 
additional credit will be used for every 100 coins returned (rounded up) per use. All monetary values outputted are in dollars (USD).
