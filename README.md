This is a Python 3 cryptocurrency calculator using data via www.coinmarketcap.com to calculate the value of a specified quantity of one or more cryptocurrencies. The information for each coin returned include the name, ticker, current rank, current price, Coinmarketcap ID, and value (according to the quantity specified by the user). This script is written for version v1 of the Coinmarketcap API documentation.

Upon successfully running the script, two credits from your Coinmarketcap account will be used immediately plus one additional credit for every 100 coins returned (rounded up) per use. All monetary values are in US dollars (USD).
